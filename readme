I developed a text-to-speech application using Java programming language. During the
development process, I utilized specific patterns and algorithms to optimize the program's
performance and speed. The program is capable of converting text into speech with high
accuracy and clarity. Additionally, I implemented various features such as voice selection,
pitch and speed adjustments, and volume control to enhance the user experience.
